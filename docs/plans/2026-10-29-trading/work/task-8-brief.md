# Task 8 brief: Whole-system security review, fixes, wrap-up

Plan: `C:\Users\ventu\OneDrive\Desktop\SLINGSHOT Creatures\docs\plans\2026-10-29-trading\plan.md` (do NOT read the whole plan; this brief is your requirements).
Spec (the binding authority, read the sections your task touches): `C:\Users\ventu\OneDrive\Desktop\SLINGSHOT Creatures\docs\specs\2026-10-29-trading-design.md`

## Task 8: Whole-system security review, fixes, wrap-up

- [ ] **Step 1:** A fresh reviewer reads the spec's safety section + every new/changed script, and attacks the code
  (not the design) against invariants 1-6 and the exploit table.
- [ ] **Step 1b: Hands-on red team** (owner, 2026-10-29: "you do the testing, use my computer if needed, to do trading
  and trying to find a hole"). The controller drives Studio with computer-use:
  - start Test > Clients and Servers with 2 players (TestFreshSave on) and do real trades between the two clients:
    same items, BACK / CANCEL, closing a client mid-Phase-2, spam-clicking, a full inventory, eggs with mutations;
  - from a client datamodel (`execute_luau`), fire every trade remote with forged arguments (other players' pet ids,
    wrong versions, early accept, huge strings, spam);
  - after each attempt, check conservation on the server.
  - Every hole found becomes a failing test + fix (Step 2).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Every Critical/Important finding gets a failing test first, then the fix, then the full suite.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Full suite once more: SaveLockTests, TradeCoreTests, TradeItemsTests, TradePresenceTests,
  TradeSimTests (partA, partB, crash, exploit, budget), TradeUITests, AutoReconnectTests, the existing StreakTests /
  StarterPackTests live parts (regression).
- [ ] **Step 4:**
  - Clean up `_Studio` test keys.
  - Set `TestFreshSave = false`.
  - File > Save to Roblox (NOT publish) and verify the new saved version through the saved-versions API.
  - Update memory + vault (game-agnostic lessons only).
  - Write the owner report: what was built, every test and its result, rulings, what the owner must do (Publish,
    then Migrate servers).

## Global Constraints
- **NEVER publish.** At the very end the controller does File > Save to Roblox only (not Publish). The owner publishes.
- **TestFreshSave:** before EVERY Play test, check `workspace:GetAttribute("TestFreshSave") == true` in Edit (set it if
  it isn't). The controller sets it back to `false` after the LAST test of the whole job.
- **Never type into the Studio command bar or click Studio dialogs.** Use `execute_luau` for DataModel work. Never set
  `Camera.CameraType` from Edit scripts.
- **Backups:** before changing any existing script, clone it into `ServerStorage._Backup_Trading.Before`, with
  `Disabled`/`Enabled = false` and all CollectionService tags stripped. One backup per script, the first time only.
- **Studio names:** every DataStore / OrderedDataStore / MemoryStore map / MessagingService topic name gets the suffix
  `_Studio` when `RunService:IsStudio()`. Studio must never read or write a live trading store. `PlayerData_v3`
  itself keeps its existing test keys (`studiotest_<tag>_<userId>` when TestFreshSave).
- **Kill switch:** `ReplicatedStorage.TradeConfig.ENABLED` (default true). When false: no Trading tile, every trade
  remote refuses, sessions can't start. Recovery and settle ALWAYS run (items in escrow must still come back).
- **Every `UpdateAsync` callback is pure** (it may run more than once): side effects only after it returns.
- **Big execute_luau work** is chunked with `task.wait()`; scripts are written with `multi_edit` or by setting
  `.Source` from `execute_luau`.
- **UI:**
  - The `check-ui-clean-roblox` skill look only: GothamBlack, slate `#3B5866` panels, `#181E22` strokes, 3D [X],
    2-tier header divider, damier fade. Reuse `ReplicatedStorage.BrickUI` (the project's Check-UI builder) wherever
    it has a piece.
  - One layout on every device (phones = the PC layout scaled).
  - The window fit rule: cap at ~58 % of the screen width, wider on short phone screens.
  - Tap targets ≥ 42 px.
- **Ship bar:** every UI screen is reviewed by a fresh reviewer and must score ≥ 8.5/10 before it counts as done.
- **Reviewers / planners = Haiku, builders = Opus** (owner rule).
- **Limits (spec section 4):**
  - 9 items per side;
  - READY locked 5 s after the last change;
  - ACCEPT locked 5 s after Phase 2 starts (and until your own escrow is saved);
  - request pop-up 30 s;
  - 1 SEND per 3 s and 10 per 5 min;
  - 3 pending requests per receiver;
  - a 30 s pair cooldown after a decline;
  - offer changes 4/s per player and 30 per 10 s per trade;
  - quick chat 1 per 1.5 s, same phrase 1 per 5 s;
  - search 1 per 2 s, list 1 per 5 s;
  - idle 3 min, total 10 min;
  - 150 pets / 150 eggs (deliveries and returns may exceed it).
- **Quick chat phrases (exact, in this order):** Add More, L Trade, Last Offer, Deal?, Fair Trade, No Thanks.


## Review Focus
1. **Existing live saves** have no `_session` / `_ver` / `_wid`. The first load after publish must take them over
   and save normally, with nothing else changed. Test in Task 1: `legacy_save_loads`.
2. **A Studio session must never touch a live trading store.** Test in Task 2: `studio_store_names`, which asserts
   every name in `TradeConfig.stores()` ends in `_Studio` in Studio.
3. **A MemoryStore / MessagingService outage must never block or break a player's join or normal play.** Only
   trading pauses. Test in Task 4: `presence_failure_does_not_block_load`, with an injected failing MemoryStore.
4. **A player over 150 pets/eggs after a delivery** can still play: selling works, new gains are refused with the
   normal message, no error. Test in Task 3: `over_cap_after_give`.
5. **The existing menu tiles, the Admin button and every other window still open and close** on PC and on a phone
   once the Trading tile is added. Test in Task 7: `menu_regression` (+ the phone emulator pass).
